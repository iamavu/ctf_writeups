- We are given a string which is encoded. And hint is also given that it is encoded twice.

```
%25%36%36%25%36%63%25%36%31%25%36%37%25%37%62%25%33%38%25%36%35%25%36%36%25%36%35%25%36%32%25%33%36%25%33%36%25%36%31%25%33%37%25%33%31%25%33%39%25%36%32%25%33%37%25%33%35%25%36%31%25%33%34%25%36%32%25%33%37%25%36%33%25%33%36%25%33%33%25%33%34%25%36%34%25%33%38%25%33%38%25%33%35%25%33%37%25%33%38%25%33%38%25%36%34%25%36%36%25%36%33%25%37%64
```

- This is an URL encoded string which gives the flag after decoding it twice.

```
flag{8efeb66a719b75a4b7c634d885788dfc}
```
