## Base3200
> Solved by: Legend


- We are given `theflag.xz` file which is used for high compression.


- The compressed file contains a file named `theflag` which contains a very long encoded string.


- At first I thought it was just `base64` with very long string but it was not getting decoded.


- I googled and found past CTF on this.
- http://dann.com.br/3dsctf-2016-misc100-base3200/ → Script didn’t work
- https://ctf-writeup.blogspot.com/2016/12/3ds-ctf.html → Script worked


- Basically what is happening here is we are dividing `3200` with `64` because the data is encoded `50` times.

```python
import base64 

file = open('theflag.txt', 'r')
file_data = file.read()

for i in range (50):
 file_data = base64.b64decode(file_data)

flag = file_data.decode('utf-8')
print(f'Flag: {flag}')
```

```
Flag: flag{340ff1bee05244546c91dea53fba7642}
```
