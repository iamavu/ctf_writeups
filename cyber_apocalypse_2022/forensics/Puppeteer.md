## Puppeteer
> Solved By : Legend, Starrylord, Taz, thewhiteh4t

In this challenge we were given Windows Event logs files and in all these the one that most interesting were the Powershell ones.

After that I used Event Viewer to look into these files and in `Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational` found an interesting event where code was executed remotely and the description contained obfuscated powershell script.

The whole script

In the powershell script we have some interesting things :

```powershell
[byte[]] $stage1 = 0x99, 0x85, 0x93, 0xaa, 0xb3, 0xe2, 0xa6, 0xb9, 0xe5, 0xa3, 0xe2, 0x8e, 0xe1, 0xb7, 0x8e, 0xa5, 0xb9, 0xe2, 0x8e, 0xb3;

[byte[]] $stage2 = 0xac, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xe2, 0xb2, 0xe0, 0xa5, 0xa2, 0xa4, 0xbb, 0x8e, 0xb7, 0xe1, 0x8e, 0xe4, 0xa5, 0xe1, 0xe1;

[array]::Reverse($stage2);

$stage3 = $stage1 + $stage2;

for($i=0;$i -lt $stage3.count;$i++){
    $stage3[$i] = $stage3[$i] -bxor 0xd1;
}
```

- two sets of hex arrays
- stage 2 is reversed
- stage 1 and reversed stage 2 are concatenated
- each item in stage 3 array is XORed against `0xd1`

I followed the steps and got the flag in cyberchef :
