## tablet 1
> Solved by : thewhiteh4t

- we are given an iPad image in this challenge
- goal was to find a server where the data was exfiltrated
- so a guess was that I will find a server and flag will be present on it
- following this theory I looked for the string `uiuc.tf` because thats the domain being used in all remote based challenges


    grep -rni "uiuc.tf" .

- this is a Sqlite3 database file
- I found SSH private key and other login info required for login

- SSH login
    ssh -i id_rsa red@red.chal.uiuc.tf -p 42069


- the private key is encrypted and the password is actually :
    ********


- but on login I got a message that service allows only SFTP connections, so I tried logging in with SFTP

- unlike most ctf challenges flag was not available after login so I downloaded `.bash_history` using `get` command

- and in this location I found a JPG imageâ€¦
