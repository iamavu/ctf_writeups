“Charlie Chaplin has gotten into software development, coding, and the like... He made a company, but it recently came under fire for a PR disaster. He got **all over the internet** before he realized the company's mistake, and is now scrambling to clean up his mess, but it may be too late!! Find his Twitter Account and investigate! *NOTE THAT THESE CHALLENGES DO NOT HAVE DO BE DONE IN ORDER!”*

search “Chaplin Chaplin Coding” on twitter and you will get one result

https://twitter.com/ChaplinCoding

Now go to the “view lists” under the three dots next to follow (You need an account to see it)

You’ll find the flag in the second list
