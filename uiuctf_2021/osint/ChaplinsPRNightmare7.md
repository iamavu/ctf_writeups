“Chaplin left some code up on GitHub which may be the actual PR nightmare I hope not though... Leaked code is bad. Find it!!!
The inner content of this flag begins with **"th"**”

Now this time search up “Charlie Chaplin” and there should be only 4 results under user
you’ll figure out the profile under https://github.com/charliechaplindev

Scroll down their history and you’ll see an issue stating “ [SECRET KEY SECRET KEY THIS IS BAD THIS IS BAD](https://github.com/charliechaplindev/C3D-Official/issues/3)” Click on that and you’ll get the flag


    Flag: uiuctf{th3_TrUe_pR_N1gHtm@r3}
