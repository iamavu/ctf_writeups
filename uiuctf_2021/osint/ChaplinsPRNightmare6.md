## Chaplin's PR Nightmare - 6
> Solved by : choco

“Wow Charlie even set up a linkedin account, but not well it is kind of a mess. Is the PR nightmare here??
The inner content of this flag begins with **"pr"**“
This time you should go to linkedin to search up their name.

I searched up “C3D” as specified from their website to get their profile

https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13984825/

Go to their owners page and under his profile he’ll mention “I ran a event called "**Top Hat Development Night**". It was very cool, you can find it on linkedin still search it up”

Search up "**Top Hat Development Night**" under events and you’ll get the event and flag under it
