“Charlie made an advertisement to promote his company, he is using the modern media platform YouTube to present it! Can you find it?”

Searching up “Charlie Chaplin Coding” on google shows up this channel or the link is given from the previous challenge twitter account

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxPyHVMa8TyKrOj05x86osA

Click on the only video there and there will be the flag at almost the end of the video
