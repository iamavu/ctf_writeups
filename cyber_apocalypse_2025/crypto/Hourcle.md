- In this challenge, we are given a python server script: `server.py`. Let‚Äôs analyze this script and see if we can find any weakness.

```
    from Crypto.Cipher import AES
    from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad
    import os, string, random, re
    KEY = os.urandom(32)
    password = ''.join([random.choice(string.ascii_letters+string.digits) for _ in range(20)])
    def encrypt_creds(user):
        padded = pad((user + password).encode(), 16)
        IV = os.urandom(16)
        cipher = AES.new(KEY, AES.MODE_CBC, iv=IV)
        ciphertext = cipher.decrypt(padded)
        return ciphertext
    def admin_login(pwd):
        return pwd == password
    
    def show_menu():
        return input('''

    def main():
        while True:
            ch = show_menu()
            print()
            if ch == '1':
                username = input('[+] Speak thy name, so it may be sealed in the archives :: ')
                pattern = re.compile(r"^\w{16,}$")
                if not pattern.match(username):
                    print('[-] The ancient scribes only accept proper names-no forbidden symbols allowed.')
                    continue
                encrypted_creds = encrypt_creds(username)
                print(f'[+] Thy credentials have been sealed in the encrypted scrolls: {encrypted_creds.hex()}')
            elif ch == '2':
                pwd = input('[+] Whisper the sacred incantation to enter the Forbidden Sanctum :: ')
                if admin_login(pwd):
                    print(f"[+] The gates open before you, Keeper of Secrets! {open('flag.txt').read()}")
                    exit()
                else:
                    print('[-] You salt not pass!')
            elif ch == '3':
                print('[+] Thou turnest away from the shadows and fade into the mist...')
                exit()
            else:
                print('[-] The oracle does not understand thy words.')
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
```

- First issues that ChatGPT helped me noticed is that `encrypt_creds` function uses `cipher.decrypt()` instead of `cipher.encrypt()`, which means the encryption logic is incorrect.
- The `password` is a random 20-character alphanumeric string.
- `encrypt_creds(user)` takes a username, appends the password, pads the result to 16-byte blocks, and encrypts it using **AES-CBC** with a **random IV**.


- Exploit logic:
    - Since the **AES block size is 16 bytes**, any username of **16 bytes or longer** ensures that the password starts in a new block.
    - Send a 47-character username (`'A' * 47`), ensuring the password starts in a new block.
    - This will make sure that the first character of the password is at the end of the third block and now we can proceed with the brute force attack.


- Here is the script I‚Äôve written with the help of ChatGPT to brute force password:

```
    from pwn import *
    import string
    
    HOST = "<HOST_IP>"
    PORT = <HOST_PORT>
    CONN = remote(HOST, PORT)
    
    def fetch_scroll(payload):
        CONN.recvuntil(b"Choose your path, traveler :: ")
        CONN.sendline(b"1")
        
        CONN.recvuntil(b"[+] Speak thy name, so it may be sealed in the archives :: ")
        CONN.sendline(payload.encode())
        
        CONN.recvuntil(b"[+] Thy credentials have been sealed in the encrypted scrolls: ")
        return CONN.recvline().decode().strip()
    
    def brutef_pass():
        print("Started bruteforce ...")
        
        password = ""
        pass_len = 20
        chr_set = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
        for i in range(pass_len):
            print(f"Guessing character {i+1} ...")
            payload = "A" * (47 - len(password))
            base_ct = fetch_scroll(payload)[32:96]
            for ch_ in chr_set:
                test_input = "A" * (47 - len(password)) + password + ch_
                new_ct = fetch_scroll(test_input)[32:96]
                if new_ct == base_ct:
                    password += ch_
                    print(f"Password guessed: {password}")
                    break
        print(f"Password: {password}")
    
    brutef_pass()
    CONN.interactive()
