## Sending Mixed Signals
> Solved by Starry-lord

This was a deep-dive into the headlines about the picture of Mike Waltz a US government official, the unexpected public exposure of official communications from a custom Signal application. 

In the picture, Waltz's phone screen was visibly displaying a custom Signal app, a critical tool intended for secure official communications.

The content of these supposedly secure communications was publicly accessible.
It was leaked because the appâ€™s code was on GitHub, publicly available, and unfortunately holding hard-coded credentials.

Most of the info required to solve this challenge lies within this deep-dive analysis by Micah Lee : 

[Here's the source code for the unofficial Signal app used by Trump officials](https://micahflee.com/heres-the-source-code-for-the-unofficial-signal-app-used-by-trump-officials/)

The email of the person who committed the code with credentials can be found in the article and can be matched with the commit history.

I found the leaked credentials in `app/src/tm/java/org/archiver/ArchiveConstants.kt` file within the [open-source repository](https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-Android/commit/7da4578dc009a7eddc7ffc471eb202d71826958e#diff-d05eb9cc6305fccd3938b1fbead418fd14e450f2c29e51b439c204be50737c64)

Third question could be answered by matching the dates with the releases tags.

And finally after answering all the questions correctly we get the flag :

**Key Learning & Takeaways**


- Open repositories must be scanned continuously for secrets before every commit
- Operational security lapses such as visible screens can hand attackers the exact breadcrumbs they need
- Combining public journalism with version-control forensics (commit diffs, tag timelines, author metadata) is a powerful, low-cost way to validate breaches and attribute responsibility.
