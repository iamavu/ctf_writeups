We are welcomed with an employee screening form in this challenge. We had to enter an employee email to proceed, so for testing I simply sent a random email to check for response, the page itself doesnâ€™t show any useful error response but the response of API call in browser network inspect tool shows an error message, and it leaks the valid domain the API will accept :

After adding the correct domain, the service asks for an OTP. At this point I decided to look into any available javascripts present on the page : 


    <script src="/assets/js/app.js"></script>

This script exposes few more endpoints which we can use to our advantage : 


    const tokenResponse = await fetch('/api/screen-token', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ user_id: data.user_id })
    });
    // and
    window.location.href = `/screen/?key=${tokenData.hash}`;

So we can see that `user_id` is being sent to `/api/screen-token`, this suggested that we can query it with different user IDs and see if something juicy shows, and it did on `user_id : 7` and below you can see it responded with a hash value and above you can see the script sends a hash in `key` parameter :

Sending the hash in the `key` parameter prints the flag!

**Key Learning and Takeaways**


- Always check requests : That's where we found the hidden error message leaking the valid domain the API would accept. Alternatively you can always use `burpsuite` which will intercept and show all these requests by default.
- JavaScript Often Hides Secrets : JavaScript files frequently expose hidden API endpoints, internal logic, and parameters that aren't immediately obvious from just looking at the page.
- API Endpoint Enumeration : Peeking into `app.js` revealed `/api/screen-token` and, crucially, that it expected a `user_id`. When we hit `user_id: 7`, it gave us a hash value. This is a classic pattern, when you find an API endpoint that takes an ID, try enumerating common IDs (like 1, 2, 3... or common ranges) to see what secrets it might expose.
