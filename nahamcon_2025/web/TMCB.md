## TMCB
> Solved by Legend

In this challenge there are two million checkboxes that we need to check to get the flag.

The website is using web socket's to send the checked boxes and update it on server. I tired bash script to send 300000 at a time in burp but at around 1700000 the connection got reset, so I had to make a script.

I tried using JavaScript to send the checked boxes in batch and it worked.


    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://' + location.host + '/ws');
    ws.onopen = () => {
        let i = 0;
        function send() {
            if (i >= 2000000) return;
            let numbers = [];
            for (let j = 0; j < 200000; j++) {
                numbers.push(i + j);
            }
            ws.send(JSON.stringify({ action: 'check', numbers: numbers }));
            i += 200000;
            setTimeout(send, 250);
        }
        send();
    };

Accidentally sent way more than required, but it worked.

**Key Learning and Takeaways**

- Web sockets are different from HTTP; learning how they work is useful for web challenges.
- Sending too much data at once can crash the connection; break it into smaller parts and add a delay.
- You don't need to fully know a programming language to write useful scripts experimenting helps.
- Automating tasks with code is often more effective than using manual tools like Burp.
- Code doesnâ€™t need to be perfect, if it works, it works.
