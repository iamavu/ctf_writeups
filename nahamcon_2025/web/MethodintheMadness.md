## Method in the Madness
> Solved by thewhiteh4t

Six checkboxes are displayed, when we click on `/interesting` one checkbox is ticked. Goal was to tick all checkbox and hope for it to reveal the flag.

Hint is in the name of the challenge : Method â†’ HTTP Methods

So we just have to try different methods on `/interesting`


    curl http://challenge.nahamcon.com:31661/interesting
    curl -X POST http://challenge.nahamcon.com:31661/interesting
    curl -X PUT http://challenge.nahamcon.com:31661/interesting
    curl -X PATCH http://challenge.nahamcon.com:31661/interesting
    curl -X DELETE http://challenge.nahamcon.com:31661/interesting
    curl -X OPTIONS http://challenge.nahamcon.com:31661/interesting

After running all curl command, flag appears!

**Key Learning and Takeaways**


- Beyond Just GET and POST : We all know GET and POST methods, but there are more HTTP methods such as :
    - PUT (for creating or updating resources)
    - PATCH (for partial updates)
    - DELETE (for removing resources)
    - OPTIONS (for asking the server what methods it supports)
- This challenge was a perfect example of how foundational web knowledge combined with simple tools can show new things while testing.
