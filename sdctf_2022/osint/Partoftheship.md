Part of the ship...
Sometimes I worry about my friend... he's way too into memes, he's always smiling, and he's always spouting nonsense about some "forbidden app." I don't know what he's talking about, but maybe you can help me figure it out! All I know is a username he used way back in the day. Good luck! Flag format is sdctf{flag}

Username

“smiling” and “app”, reminded me of iFunny , I went to https://ifunny.co/user/DanFlashes
but it gave a 404, so first thing usually which I do is check on wayback machine and boom, we got our flag

FLAG - `sdctf{morning_noon_and_night_I_meme}`
