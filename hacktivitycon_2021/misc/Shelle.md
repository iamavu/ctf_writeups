most of the 
using the research from the previous integrity challenge I tried using a hex decoding via
`echo -e` however everything including``(backticks)` and `/` are filtered.
luckily `$()` isnâ€™t so i crafted the payload and got the flag:


    cat $(echo -e "\x2f\x6f\x70\x74\x2f\x66\x6c\x61\x67\x2e\x74\x78\x74")
