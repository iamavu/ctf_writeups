## Titanic
> Solved By : thewhiteh4t


- In this challenge we were given a website of a company
- Two things which instantly caught attention were `URL Capture` and `Admin` buttons
- URL capture service accepts a URL and takes screenshot of the webpage

- Admin page got a login
- First idea was to try `http://localhost` and it worked

- This is same as the loading splash screen I saw while loading the challenge website
- Next I checked `robots.txt` and got 200 and this revealed a new path `/server-status`

- Next I obviously tried to access `/server-status` and got 200 again
