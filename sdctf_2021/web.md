## Apollo 1337
> Solved By : Nigamelastic and thewhiteh4t

* [https://space.sdc.tf/](https://space.sdc.tf/)

* On view the page source we find something interesting:

```javascript
<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">
    {
        "props": {"pageProps":{}},
        "page":"/",
        "query":{},
        "buildId":"QQvgkUHNyaIn68Led0yAi",
        "nextExport":true,
        "autoExport":true,
        "isFallback":false
    }
</script>
```
* on performing a GET request with :

```json
{
    "GET":{
        "scheme":"https",
        "host":"space.sdc.tf",
        "filename":"/api/status",
        "remote":{
            "Address":"172.67.178.219:443"
        }
    }
}
```

* we get a response

```json
{
    "status":"health",
    "longStatus":"Healthy. All routes are functioning properly.",
    "version":"1.0.0"
}
```

* only playing around i see three endpoints

```json
{
    "status":"health",
    "longStatus":"Healthy. All routes are functioning properly.",
    "version":"1.0.0",
    "routes":[
        {
            "path":"/status",
            "status":"healthy"
        },
        {
            "path":"/rocketLaunch",
            "status":"healthy"
        },
        {
            "path":"/fuel",
            "status":"healthy"
        }
    ]
}
```

* hitting the `/fuel` endpoint we get

```json
[
    {
        "name":"west1 pump",
        "id":0
    },
    {
        "name":"east1 pump",
        "id":1
    },
    {
        "name":"south1 pump",
        "id":2
    },
    {
        "name":"north1 pump",
        "id":3
    },
    {
        "name":"west2 pump",
        "id":4
    },
    {
        "name":"lil pump",
        "id":5
    }
]
```

* hitting `/rocketLaunch` with a simple GET request 

```
request body must be json
```

* But since we have to launch the rocket we can assume that we need to POST something to the endpoint
* One of the first few things that come to mind is the **launch** keyword
* we know that endpoint expects a JSON body
* we first sent : 

```json
{
    "launch":true
}
```

* we get the above response, lets specify a random rocket name since we dont know the rocket name

* endpoint tell us that **triton** is available

* now we need a launch time but we don't know what format it expects so we tried to make it tell us again

* after sending time in correct format we get this

* we can get a list of pumps and their IDs from /fuel endpoint

* interesting, now it wants a token, so we looked into the page source, we did not find anything so we started looking into the JS files of the web app and we found the token

* after sending the token we get our flag!

## GETS Request
> Solved By : thewhiteh4t

* The challenge hints at memory issues
* we can enter an integer and the web app sends a reply
* there are few checks which the web app makes:

```javascript
if(!req.query.n) {
    res.status(400).send('Missing required parameter n');
    return;
}
```
* so `n` cannot be blank

```javascript
const BUFFER_SIZE = 8;

if(req.query.n.length > BUFFER_SIZE) {
    res.status(400).send('Requested n too large!');
    return;
}
```

* so max length of `n` can be `8`
* the web app does not check for duplicate parameters, so we can send another n along with the first

## Git Good

* Robots reveal an `admin` page and `.git` directory

![](https://i.imgur.com/vORc05a.png)

* I used a very useful tool which helps to dump file contents of websites which use GIT version control system
* https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools

* `.git` directory dumped :

![](https://i.imgur.com/zfQ1jga.png)

* now we can use extractor to get files from the dump

* I found 2 `users.db` files, both are sqlite3 databases
* one contains `bcrypt` hashes and other one contains `md5` hashes
* I cracked md5 hashes first because they take less time

* one valid credential found :

```
aaron@cgau.sdc.tf : weakpassword
```

* login on `admin.html` and we get the flag
