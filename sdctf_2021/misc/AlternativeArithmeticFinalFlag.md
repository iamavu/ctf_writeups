## Alternative Arithmetic (Final Flag)
> Solved By : nigamelastic and choco

* I will use the following to run [this](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler) java compiler to run my code online.

* on connecting we see the first question which is:

```
4th question :

Enter 3 `String` values `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` such that:
```
```java
new BigDecimal(s1).add(new BigDecimal(s2)).compareTo(new BigDecimal(s3)) == 0
```
but
```java
Double.parseDouble(s1) + Double.parseDouble(s2) != Double.parseDouble(s3)
```
```
Do not enter quotation marks.
```

* answer 4 worked but very stupidly: i will paste my inputs and outputs and you just see :

**First attempt**
```bash
Do not enter quotation marks.
s1 = 0.004
s2 = -0.003
s3 = 0.001
Sorry, your answer is not correct. Try something else next time.
```
**Second attempt**
```bash
s1 = 20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000004
s2 = -10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000003
s3 = 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
Sorry, your answer is not correct. Try something else next time.
```

**Third attempt**
```bash
s1 = 0.04
s2 = -0.03
s3 = 0.01
Perfect! You are correct.
```

* credits to choco, who guided me, and after our discussion we realised for some reason `0.04` is working but `0.004` isnâ€™t
choco also pointed out this amazing link https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html

* finally we discussed and realized the following :

* according to double :
```bash
0.003 will be represented as 3.00000000000000006245004513517E-3
0.004 will be represented as 4.00000000000000008326672684689E-3
0.02 will be represented as 2.00000000000000004163336342344E-2

but 

0.03 will be represented 2.99999999999999988897769753748E-2 
```

* after this stupidity we finally get the 5th and final option:

```
5. Final question! [ðŸŽ¶BOSS MUSICðŸŽ¶]

Fill in <type>, <num1>, <num2> below:
```
```java
var i = (<type>) <num1>; var j = (<type>) <num2>;
```
```
such that after running the code above, the following expression:
```
```java
i < j || i == j || i > j
```
```
evaluates to `false`.

<num1> and <num2> are Java code that satisfies this regex: [0-9]*\.?[0-9]*
```

* which is very easy , I remember it from my college days
* its `Integer 128`
* this is due to the integer cache limits
* the following link would be a better explanation
