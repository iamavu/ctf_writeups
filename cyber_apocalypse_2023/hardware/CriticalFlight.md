Challenge description

![](https://i.imgur.com/9WJANW7.png)


Similar to Timed Transmission, the flag is directly visible to us when we open the .zip folder in GerbView Software (https://www.gerbview.com/download.html). 

First part of the Flag is visible directly when all the layers of the PCB board are set to be visible.

Selecting and unselecting, layer by layer; we can get the rest part of the flag too.
