Challenge description


> In order to proceed, we need to start with the basics. Start an instance, connect to it via $ nc e.g. nc 127.0.0.1 1337 and send "1" to get the flag.

This challenge is basically how to connect to `netcat` and the instructions are given in the description itself. I just followed it and got the flag.
