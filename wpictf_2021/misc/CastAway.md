## Cast_Away

> solved by : chronocruz.exe

* We are provided with Minecraft world data.
* Extract the files and now we need a tool called the NBT Explorer which can be used to read Minecraftâ€™s proprietary Named Binary Tag (NBT) file format.
* Now the description says three players ran off with the flag.
* So the flag must be split between the three players.

* Opening the first file in playerdata folder we get

* Further expanding and studying the tree we find

* The value of EnderItems > tag > display > Name seems to be the end part of a flag.
Note this value down.

* Repeating the process for the next playerdata file

* This time we find a flag like string in Inventory > tag > pages

* For the third playerdata however :
    * There was no relevant information directly visible in the data.
    * Looking at the coordinates of the player we find

* Using the Search > Chunk Finder function
* We input X and Z coordinates but I was unable to find the exact chunk/block values.

* Moving onto a second tool called Universal Minecraft Editor which a wonderful tool available for free at https://www.universalminecrafteditor.com/

* We load the minecraft world data into this tool and using the chunk locator input X and Z coordinates

* We see there is a sign post within the chunk we located.
* Opening this chunk reveals the in-game objects within this region and their attributes

* We clearly see the value of Text2 looks like the beginning of our string
* Concatenating the three parts we get the full string that is our flag
