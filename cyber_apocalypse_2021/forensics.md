* Unzip and find 'Alien Weaknesses.pptx'
* Unzip again and go to ppt/slides/_rels/
* Read slide1.xml.rels to find a suspicious relation tag

* So we get a docm file. 
* I start by unzippping the word document 
* We get a docm
* Unzip it again and see folders

**PART 1**

* First thing I tried to do after looking around was 

```bash
strings vbaProject.bin
```

* Which gives back interesting hex lines.

* Then decrypt from hex

* From base64 urlsafe alphabet will show the following

```
CHTB{maldocs_are
```

**PART 2**

* Upload full vbaProject file this time and do the same as before.

* Use base64 urlsafe alphabet
* We get second part of the flag by reversing

```
_the_new_meta}

## Oldest trick in the book

> Solved by : thewhiteh4t


* We are given a pcap which consists of mostly TLS and ICMP traffic
* ICMP looks promising as we can see the header of ZIP file `PK`

![](https://i.imgur.com/bcZ05AG.png)

* Another thing was that the the traffic from both IP address was similar I focused on only one of them


![](https://i.imgur.com/Iq12mh1.png)

* To extract data of all these packets I used tshark

```bash
$ tshark -r older_trick.pcap -T fields -e data.data -Y "ip.src == 192.168.1.7" > 192.168.1.7.txt
```

* After this I looked for duplicate packets in the text file

![](https://i.imgur.com/NoiYgXk.png)

* So we have 10127 unique icmp data packets
* To decode hex and compile all the data I created a small python script
* But I was not getting proper file format of resultant file so I inspected the data
* There were duplicates in the data as well!

```
b7ae04 0000000000 504b0304140000000000729e8d52659b 504b0304140000000000729e8d52659b 504b030414000000
ead104 0000000000 4c6b1800000018000000100000006669 4c6b1800000018000000100000006669 4c6b180000001800
99e804 0000000000 6e692f6164646f6e732e6a736f6e7b22 6e692f6164646f6e732e6a736f6e7b22 6e692f6164646f6e
cafb04 0000000000 736368656d61223a362c226164646f6e 736368656d61223a362c226164646f6e 736368656d61223a
```

* This is the data from first 4 packets for an example
* After first 6 characters we have 10 zeroes
* After that a unique string
* The string is repeated after that
* Then a partial repetition can be seen at the end
* I tried various combinations and in the end only the unique string was needed from each packet i.e `504b0304140000000000729e8d52659b` for first line as an example

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import binascii
msg = []
with open('unique.txt', 'r') as raw:
    raw_arr = raw.readlines()
for line in raw_arr:
    if len(line) == 97:
        line = line.strip()
        line = line[16:48]
        plain = binascii.unhexlify(line)
        msg.append(plain)
with open('result.zip', 'wb') as res:
    for line in msg:
        res.write(line)
```

* The script iterates over each line in the file and skips empty lines if it finds any
* Then it slices of extra characters as stated above
* Then it decodes the hex into binary data and appends it in a file

* And we get a proper zip file!
* Here are the extracted contents of the zip

* After some enumeration of all files they point towards Mozilla Firefox
* After some googling I found that this is a firefox profile dump
* In linux the default path for profiles is `/home/user/.mozilla/firefox`
* I copied the folder into profiles folder and then edited the `profiles.ini` file present inside it to add the following entry

```
[Profile2]
Name=fini
Path=fini
IsRelative=1
```

* After this I launched firefox from CLI using 

```bash
$ firefox -P
```

* It provides an option to choose a specific profile and launch the browser with it

* After the browser launched with the new profile and checked the saved logins and here we have the flag!
