## Serial Logs

> Solved by : Nigamelastic

* `.sal` files are saleae logic analyzer files. 
* I got this as reference https://dystopia.sg/allesctf20-PWNkemon/
so i downloaded the sla logic analyzer
https://www.saleae.com/downloads/
* from here after installing, i opened the sal files which i could and then the following:
* I imported the value i am pretty sure if i find the right analyzer it should work

* by far for this challenge async serial works the best
* challenge states raspberry pi which has a baud rate of 115200
* after some pondering i realized that there are some errors in parity on fixing them and using the `115200` in async serial we get the hex converting which gives us this:

* found this : https://6e726d.github.io/Challenge/Ekoparty15/
* this writeup explains how to get the baud rate
* open the SAL file and zoom

* until you see the smallest unit of the digital wave then measure it: as its 13.498

![](https://i.imgur.com/j0S5hvd.png)

* since it is in **Î¼** we will divide it by 1000000
* so 1000000/13.498 = 74085.049637
* I obviously used 74000 as bit rate, converted the hex to ascii with the tool itself and it gave me the flag:
