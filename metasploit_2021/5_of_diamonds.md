```
Port 11111
```

This was an SQL Injection vulnerability. We had many problems for this one in terms of stability, in fact only one could attack it with sqlmap at the time.

We managed to get the password out from the database, which was a very long alpha-numeric string, bigger than max amount of chars accepted by the input field on the login page.

Passing the password with burp solved the problem and displayed a link to flag.png

### Afterthought

We could bypass login through the username field with 

```
username=X'or 1=1 --
password=notThePassword
```

but i missed that we could also simply bypass authentication with the password field:

```
username=admin
password='or 1=1 --
```
